            <h1>About PaddleTraffic</h1>
        </header>
        <p>At PaddleTraffic, our mission is to revolutionize the way pickleball enthusiasts find and join games at local
            courts.
            Recognizing the growing popularity of pickleball — now the fastest-growing sport in the United States — we
            identified a need for an innovative solution to help players easily locate available courts and join games.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>PaddleTraffic was born from a simple vision: to make pickleball more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
            Whether
            you’re a beginner or a seasoned player, our platform is designed to help you find the perfect spot to play,
            connect
            with fellow enthusiasts, and enjoy the game to its fullest.</p>
        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>PaddleTraffic is the brainchild of a passionate team of pickleball fans and tech experts: Brensen Villegas,
            Camron
            Wilson, Ian McBride, and Jacob Knowlton. Each member brings unique skills and a shared love for the game,
            driving us
            to
            create the most user-friendly and efficient pickleball court locator.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our website and mobile app offer a real-time map displaying pickleball courts in your area. With just a tap,
            you can
            view detailed information about each court, including the number of available courts, current occupancy,
            waiting
            times,
            and historical data trends. This instant insight helps you decide where to play, saving you time and
            enhancing your
            playing experience.</p>

        <h2>Beyond Finding Courts</h2>
        <p>But we don’t just stop at helping you find courts. PaddleTraffic also facilitates proximity matchmaking and
            team
            formation, enabling you to connect with other players looking to form a group or complete a team.</p>

        <h2>Community-Driven Data</h2>
        <p>Our innovative approach to data collection relies on crowdsourcing. QR codes at court locations link players
            to our
            site, where they can report live updates on court status. This community-driven data enriches our service,
            ensuring
            accurate and current information for all users.</p>
